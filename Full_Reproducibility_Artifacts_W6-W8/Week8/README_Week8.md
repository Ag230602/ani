# Week 8 – Final Integration and Interactive Visualization

 Goal
Complete the AI-driven 3D video education platform by fusing:
- Voice-Interactive LLM (Track A)  
- Conversational Visualization (Track B)  
- Unified Streamlit + FastAPI Deployment

Voice-LLM Module
- Utilizes `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` for bidirectional speech dialogues.  
- Students can ask “Which Florida region was most affected?” and hear verbal answers linked to graph data.  
- Integrated with RAG pipeline for live reasoning + explanation.

Conversational Visualization Module
- Dynamic visual charts using `Plotly` and `Matplotlib`.  
- Displays damage distribution, FEMA funds, and timeline animations.  
- Users can ask “Show me damage severity by county” → live chart generation.

System Integration
- Merged Track A (Voice) and Track B (Viz) into the Week 7 backend.  
- Improved frontend for real-time interaction and graph updates.  
- Containerized deployment via Streamlit Cloud / Docker for public demo.  

Evaluation
| Variant | Accuracy | Latency (s) | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|

| Graph-RAG | 0.87 | 3.8 | Structured QA |
| Multi-Hop | 0.92 | 4.5 | Causal QA |
| Voice-LLM | 0.93 | 4.9 | Audio dialogues |
| Final App | 0.96 | 5.2 | Full UI with Viz + Speech |

Files Included
- env_week8.json – environment snapshot  
- week8_run_config.json – final integration settings  
- ablation_results_week8.csv – evaluation metrics

Future Enhancements
- Add multi-modal embedding fusion (text + audio + image).  
- 24-FPS video expansion for smoother animations.  
- Integration with FEMA education APIs for live data.  
- Deploy Docker image with public Streamlit link.
