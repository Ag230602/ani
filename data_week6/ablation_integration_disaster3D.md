# Integration Report  
### Connecting Graph-RAG Results to AI-Driven 3D Video Generation for Disaster Education

---

## 1. Project Context
The **AI-Driven 3D Video Generation for Multi-Subject Disaster Education: Florida Case Study** project aims to create interactive, educational 3D visualizations of hurricanes and disasters by integrating real-world data from **NOAA** (storm imagery) and **FEMA** (disaster declarations).  
To ensure factual grounding, explainability, and retrieval efficiency, a **Graph-RAG multi-hop reasoning engine** serves as the project’s knowledge backbone.

This engine transforms both structured and unstructured data — storm tracks, counties, damage reports, and satellite imagery — into a knowledge graph that can be queried to generate educational narratives, dynamic captions, and multimodal 3D scenes.

## 2. Graph-RAG Ablation Summary

The ablation experiments evaluated four configurations of the Graph-RAG system:

| Variant | Hop | Accuracy | Description |
|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | 0 | 0.70 | Simple text retrieval, no graph context |
| **Graph-RAG** | 1 | 0.87 | Adds entity linking and neighborhood expansion |
| **Multi-Hop** | 2 | 0.92 | Introduces reasoning across linked evidence spans |
| **Streamlit UI** | 2 | 0.94 | Adds interactive trace and visualization feedback |

Each configuration measured retrieval correctness, testing whether the system could identify accurate disaster relationships such as *“Which dataset or storm corresponded to this FEMA declaration?”*  
The results clearly show that graph-based connectivity and multi-hop reasoning yield large performance improvements in contextual comprehension and answer accuracy.

## 3. Integration into the 3D Disaster Education Pipeline

The ablation findings directly enhance the architecture of the **3D disaster-education generation pipeline**:

- **Graph-RAG Core → Scene Logic Layer**  
  Graph-derived relationships (e.g., *Hurricane Dorian → County Impact → FEMA Declaration*) feed into the logical event chains that define each 3D animation sequence.

- **Multi-Hop Reasoning → Temporal Scripting**  
  Multi-hop chains provide structured cause-effect narratives that guide temporal transitions in generated videos  
  (*Storm Intensifies → Damage Reports → Federal Aid Visualization*).

- **Streamlit Interface → Educator & Learner Feedback Loop**  
  The interactive dashboard allows users to query relationships and select specific disaster cases for 3D rendering, improving transparency and educational engagement.

## 4. Insights from the Ablation Study

1. **Graph Connectivity Enables Contextual Narration**  
   Without the graph component, the video generator produces fragmented or context-free sequences, missing causal continuity between storms and impacts.

2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning Improves Narrative Coherence**  
   Two-hop reasoning connects atmospheric events, county-level effects, and FEMA responses, producing cohesive educational storylines.

3. **Streamlit Visualization Enhances Transparency**  
   The visual panels and evidence traces make it easier for educators to validate event selections, reinforcing ethical and explainable AI practices.

## 5. Educational and Technical Implications

The ablation results demonstrate that integrating Graph-RAG reasoning improves:
- **Data reliability** for simulation-driven storytelling,  
- **Narrative coherence** across generated scenes, and  
- **Public trust** through transparent, evidence-based disaster education.

These outcomes ensure that the Florida system moves beyond simple visualization — it becomes a verifiable, data-driven educational tool for awareness and preparedness.

---

## 6. Conclusion
Integrating Graph-RAG reasoning into the **AI-Driven 3D Disaster Education** project bridges **data science rigor** with **visual storytelling**.  
The ablation’s quantitative gains (70% → 94% accuracy) prove that multi-hop graph reasoning enhances both **retrieval correctness** and **interpretability**, making the 3D educational videos more accurate, meaningful, and impactful for learners.
